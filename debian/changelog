nspr (4.7.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Make libnspr4-0d conflict with old libnspr4, which can

nspr (4.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libnspr4-dev.install, debian/libnspr4-0d.install: Don't install so
    files in the -dev package but in the library package. It will allow
    external applications linked against upstream nspr to work on Debian with
    system nspr libraries, and will avoid all browsers to have to implement
    symlinks themselves to allow some external plugins to work properly.
  * debian/control: Make libnspr4-0d conflict with older versions of
    libnspr4-dev and libnspr4-dev need newer libnspr4-0d accordingly.

nspr (4.7.0~1.9b1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/*.symbols.*: Remove "../../" workaround now that dh_makeshlibs
    supports symbols files includes properly.
  * debian/control:
    + Build depend on debhelper (>= 5.0.62), where this happened. Remove
      dpkg-dev versioned build-dependency, as debhelper already depends
      on the proper one, and this dependency is obviously not going to be
      dropped.
    + Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.3.0. No changes needed.
